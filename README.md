Over Look is a Turing Mod2 project which acts as a Hotel management application. This application allows a user to log in and see their previous/current/furture books, the total amount they have spent on rooms. It also allows a user search for available rooms by the date and to sort the availble rooms by roomtype and add a new booking. I implemented Sass, jQuery, Webpack, and Fetch methods GET and POST. I was able to achieve a 98% for accessiblity on the devtools audits.
